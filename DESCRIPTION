Description: Similarly to lavaan.survey, this package ties together lavaan (for
    SEM) and survey (for complex survey designs). Contrary to lavaan.survey,
    however, this experimental package allows the lavaan model to have been
    fitted by FIML. It does not do estimation, only standard errors. Since the
    point estimates as well as se's will be affected by weights, weights cannot
    be accounted for.
